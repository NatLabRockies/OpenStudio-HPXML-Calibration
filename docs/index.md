# Getting Started

Generate an HPXML model of home energy use, calibrated to utility data.

!!! note "Nearly everyone will interact solely with the command line interface"
    Custom workflows can be built using the classes & methods. See the `Code Documentation` section for more information. For advanced users only.

- `openstudio-hpxml-calibration --help`
- Or the short version: `oshc -h`

## [Required inputs](inputs.md)

- An [HPXML model](https://hpxml.nrel.gov/)
    - Possibly generated by an [OSW file](inputs.md#osw-file-defining-the-home) (JSON) for the `BuildResidentialHPXML` measure
- [Measured consumption data](inputs.md#config-file):
    - In the HPXML model, or
    - A CSV file of utility data
- A [config file](inputs.md#config-file) specific to the home being calibrated

## Usage instructions

1. If necessary, generate an HPXML model from your OSW: `openstudio run --workflow <existing_home.osw> --measures_only`
1. Use the `calibrate` command of the app. Required parameters:
    - path to hpxml file
    - path to the config file for that home

    `oshc calibrate --hpxml-filepath path/to/asdf.xml --config-filepath path/to/qwer.yml`

1. Optional parameters for the `calibrate` command:
    - path to csv of consumption data (if using that technique)
    - path to output-dir: to save in a custom location
    - num-proc: integer number of processor cores to use for parallel simulations
    - save-all-results: boolean to capture all intermediate steps. Useful for debugging
    - verbose: flag to enable more verbose logging during operation. Can be repeated for increased output

    `oshc calibrate --hpxml-filepath path/to/asdf.xml --config-filepath path/to/qwer.yml --csv-bills-filepath path/to/bcde.csv --output-dir path/to/test_output --num-proc 8 save-all-results True --verbose --verbose`

## Outputs

- A folder for each generation of attempt during calibration, with the hpxml model considered
- `logbook.json` which captures all the outputs at each generation, and which iteration was used to continue the search
- `best_individual.xml` model, the final model which meets the calibration requirements set in the config file
- Plots to gain insight into the calibration
